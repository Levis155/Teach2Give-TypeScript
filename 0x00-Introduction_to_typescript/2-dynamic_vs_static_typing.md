# Dynamic vs. Static Typing

All major programming languages that we work with are either **dynamically typed** or **statically typed.**

**Dynamically typed** means that the type of variables can change at runtime, meaning that you don't need to declare variable types.

Examples of dynamically typed languages include: JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python e.t.c.

**For instance:**

```js
// A variable x can start off as a number and later assigned a string with no issue:

let x = 8;
x = 'Levis';
console.log(x);
```

**output:**

```
Levis
```

**Statically typed** means that the type of variables cannot change once declared.

In statically typed languages data types are checked at compile time, meaning you must explicitly declare or infer variable types.

Some statically typed languages include: TypeScript, Java, C++, C#, Swift e.t.c.
