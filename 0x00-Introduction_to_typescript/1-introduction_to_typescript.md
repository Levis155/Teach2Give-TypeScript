# Introduction to Typescript

Typescript is a statically typed language that was designed and is currently being maintained by Microsoft.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and not its replacement, all the features available in JavaScript exist in TypeScript, and it extends these features and adds more functionality.

Using TypeScript allows us to check errors at **compile time.**
