# JavaScript vs TypeScript

Some key differences between JavaScript and TypeScript are:

- **Typing:** JavaScript is dynamically typed while TypeScrip is statically typed with optional dynamic typing.

- **Error detection** - In JavaScript errors are detected at **runtime** while in TypeScript errors are detected at **compile time**

- **Tooling** - JavaScript has basic support for code completion and debugging wihle TypeScript has enhanced IDE support with autocompletion, type-checking, and better refactoring tools.

- **Compilation** - JavaScript runs directly in the browser without the need for compilation while TypeScript needs to be converted into JavaScript before execution in the browser.
