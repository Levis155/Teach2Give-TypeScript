# TypeScript Types

TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors and  improve code maintainability.


Types define the shape of data, ensuring that values behave as expected throughout a program.

## Why use types in TypeScript

- Prevents runtime errors by catching issues at compile time.

- Improves code readability and maintainability.

- Enables better tooling support, including Intellisense and auto-completions
